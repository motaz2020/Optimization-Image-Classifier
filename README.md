# Optimization-Image-Classifiers

This project explores techniques for optimizing image classifiers, showcasing experiments, code examples, and results for various classifier optimization strategies using Jupyter Notebooks.
Perfect for students, researchers, and practitioners looking to boost their understanding of image classification and optimization.


## **üöÄ Project Highlights**

### **Image Preprocessing: **
Notebooks demonstrate techniques such as histogram equalization, edge detection, and image masking, laying the groundwork for efficient feature extraction.

###Classifier Optimization:
Experiments explore different approaches to boost model accuracy, such as tweaking input features, modifying preprocessing steps, and iteratively refining classifier parameters.

###Step-by-Step Experimentation:
Milestone notebooks document the iterative process, from initial data handling through to advanced optimization and model evaluation.

###Comprehensive Documentation:
The included PDF report (CSE473_MajorTask_Fall2022.pdf) provides thorough background, methodology, observations, and conclusions.
